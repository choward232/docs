## Ekho Dealer Triggers

Below are all the Ekho Dealer triggers you have at your disposal on Zapier. You are free to create other zaps that leverage these triggers in whichever ways you like (e.g. creating a new item in your ERP system every time a Newly Purchased Vehicle trigger is fired). Don’t, however, use these triggers to create new orders in your e-commerce site; we already do this automatically.
