description: 'This page provides a simple example of how to use Zapier to listen to newly purchased vehicles.'

<Info>
	In the below example, we show you how to start creating a Zap that is
	triggered by a newly purchased vehicle being created. **Note:** this trigger
	only returns an ID. If you want to use vehicle data (rather than just the
	vehicle id), it will be important to add Ekho actions in subsequent Zap
	steps such as `Fetch Purchased Vehicle Data` (using vehicle ID as input) and
	`Fetch Buyer Data` (using buyerId as input fetched from the output of `Fetch
	Purchased Vehicle Data`)
